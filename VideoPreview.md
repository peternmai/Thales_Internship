# Video Preview

Passenger aircraft nowadays are filled with digital contents that are constantly
being swapped in and out. The goal of this project is to figure out a way to show
previews for any given media file as the user scrubs the seek bar without the need
to perform any pre-processing on the media file prior to loading onto the aircraft.
