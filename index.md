# Introduction

Hello! Over the summer of 2017, we, [Peter Mai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peternmai)
and [Sarah Hie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-hi√©), took part of the Thales
Avionics' InFlyt Experience Software Internship program.

Here, we worked with various software engineers of different background to build
both internal tools and actual framework applications that would go into Thales'
AVANT in-flight entertainment system.

Over the course of 12 weeks, we have completed a total of three projects and
would love to share what we have done with you. Although we are unable to
post any source code due to copyright regulations, we do have permission
to both discuss and demo our application to you.

Below are links that would provide further information regarding each of the
three projects we have completed over the course of this internship.

# [Project 1: JIRA Ticket Delivery Tool](JiraDeliveryTool)

# [Project 2: Android Dynamic Video Preview](VideoPreview)

# [Project 3: Android In-Flight Notification Control Panel](ControlPanel)
